## Basic Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### 1. Evolution of Programming Paradigms
- **Machine-Level Programming**
  - Written in binary (0s and 1s)
  - Very difficult to understand and maintain

- **Assembly-Level Programming**
  - Uses symbolic instructions like `MOV`, `ADD`
  - Still hardware-dependent

- **Procedural Programming**
  - Program divided into functions
  - Data is separate from functions
  - Examples: C, Pascal

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Organizes code around *objects* (data + functions together)
  - Improves modularity, reusability, and maintenance


### 2. Limitations of Procedural Programming
- No proper data security (data exposed)
- Difficult to manage large-scale systems
- Low code reusability
- Real-world modeling is difficult
- Functions depend on global data (high error chances)
- Hard to extend or modify features

# What is OOP? (Object-Oriented Programming)
  OOP allows us to represent real-world entities in programming using objects, which helps in writing organized, reusable, and easy-to-maintain code.
  
- As the name suggests object in Progamming Language

### 3. Features of OOP

#### a. Object
A real-world entity having **state** (data) and **behavior** (methods).

#### b. Class
A blueprint or template for creating objects.

#### c. Abstraction
Shows only essential features and hides internal details.

#### d. Encapsulation
Wrapping data + functions inside a single unit (class). Ensures data protection.

#### e. Inheritance
One class inherits properties and methods of another. Supports reusability.

#### f. Polymorphism
One name, many forms.
- Compile-time: method overloading
- Runtime: method overriding

#### g. Dynamic Binding
Method call resolved at **runtime**.

#### h. Message Passing
Objects communicate through method calls.
Example: `obj.display()`


### 4. Applications of OOP
- GUI applications (mobile & desktop)
- Game development
- Real-time systems
- Simulation & modeling
- Database systems
- Enterprise applications (Java, C#)
- Web development (frameworks)
- Large-scale software engineering
