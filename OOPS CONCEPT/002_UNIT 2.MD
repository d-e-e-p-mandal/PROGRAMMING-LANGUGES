# Unit 2: Classes and Objects – Detailed Notes (Markdown Format)

### 1. Defining a Class

A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.  
It defines:  
	•	Data Members (variables)  
	•	Member Functions (methods)

Syntax (General Structure)
```CPP
class ClassName {
public:
    // data members
    // member functions
};

class ClassName {
    // data members
    // member functions
}
```
Example :
```CPP
class Student {
private:
    int age;
public:
    void setAge(int a) { age = a; }
};

class Student {
    private int age;
    void setAge(int a) { age = a; }
}
```

----

### 2. Creating Objects

Objects are instances of a class.

```CPP
Student s1;      // object created
```
```Java

Student s1 = new Student();
```
Each object gets its own copy of non-static data members.  

----

### 3. Class Members

Data Members

Variables that store object data.

Member Functions

Functions defined inside class for performing operations.

Example:
```CPP
class Box {
public:
    int length;  // data member
    void set(int l) { length = l; }  // member function
};
```

----

### 4. Access Specifiers

Define the visibility of class members:

public

Accessible from anywhere.

private

Accessible only inside the class.

protected

Accessible inside the class and derived classes.

Example:
```CPP
class Demo {
  private:
    int x;
  protected:
    int y;
  public:
    int z;
};
```

----

### 5. Memory Allocation for Objects

Memory is allocated only when an object is created, not when the class is defined.

Example:

class A { int a; int b; }; // no memory yet
A obj; // memory allocated for a and b

Object memory contains:
	•	Data members (one copy per object)
	•	Member functions do NOT take memory per object (shared among all objects)

----

### 6. Scope Resolution Operator (::)

Used in C++ to define functions outside the class.

Example
```CPP
class Test {
public:
    void show();
};

void Test::show() {   // scope resolution
    cout << "Hello";
}
```
Not used in Java because methods must be defined inside the class.

----

### 7. Inline Functions

Functions defined inside the class are inline by default.

Inline functions reduce function call overhead.

Example
```CPP
class Demo {
public:
    inline void show() { cout << "Inline"; }
};
```
Java does not support inline keyword; JIT handles optimization.

----

### 8. Static Data Members and Static Member Functions

🔵 Static Data Member

A static data member is a variable that belongs to the class itself, not to individual objects.

Key Points
	•	Only one copy exists for the entire class.
	•	Shared among all objects of the class.
	•	Memory is allocated only once, when the class is loaded.
	•	In C++, static data members must be defined/initialized outside the class.
	•	In Java, they are initialized inside the class.

Why use static data members?
	•	To maintain values common for all objects (e.g., object count).
	•	To track shared information.



🔵 Static Member Function

A static member function belongs to the class rather than an object.

Key Points
	•	Can be called using the class name, without creating an object.
	•	Can only access static data members (cannot access non-static members).
	•	Useful for utility or helper functions.

Why use static member functions?
	•	To operate on static data.
	•	To provide class-level operations.

C++ Example
```CPP
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Demo {
public:
    static int count;  // declaration inside class

    static void showCount() {  // static function
        cout << "Count = " << count;
    }
};

int Demo::count = 0; // initialization outside class

int main() {
    Demo::count = 5;       // accessed using class
    Demo::showCount();     // static function call
}
```
Java Example
```JAVA
class Demo {
    static int count = 0; // static variable

    static void showCount() { // static method
        System.out.println("Count = " + count);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo.count = 10;      // accessed using class
        Demo.showCount();     // static method call
    }
}
```

----

### 9. Passing Objects as Function Arguments

Objects can be passed:
	•	By value (copy)
	•	By reference (address)

C++ Example
```CPP
void display(Student s);  // pass by value
void update(Student &s);  // pass by reference
```
Java

Java passes object references by value.
```JAVA
void show(Student s) { }
```

----

### 10. Returning Objects from Functions

Functions can also return objects.

C++ Example
```CPP
Student createStudent() {
    Student s;
    return s;
}
```
Java Example
```JAVA
Student getStudent() {
    return new Student();
}
```
This is useful in:
	•	Factory methods
	•	Builders
	•	Utility classes
